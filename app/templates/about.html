        <h1 style="text-align: center;"> THE UWA HISTORICAL SOCIETY </h1>
        <br>
        <p>The UWA Historical Society commenced in 2008 from the initiatives of a small group
             led by Prof Reg Appleyard and the then Heritage Officer, Shobha Cameron. It received 
             founding financial assistance from the Convocation of UWA graduates, and the support 
             of Vice-Chancellor Prof. Alan Robson. The first event was a public lecture by Robert 
             French, the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. He recalled his ‘Halycon Days‘ as a student at UWA. 
        </p>
        <p>Further distinguished graduates and staff offered Annual Lectures in the lead-up to the
            University Centenary celebrations. The Society has conducted seminars on ‘The Founding 
            Professors’ and numerous ‘walking tours’ of the historical architectural features of the 
            Crawley Campus, together with associated publications.
       </p>      
       <p>An extensive professional quality Oral History program has been vigorously pursued. A number
            of initiatives such as an annual ceremony to mark Remembrance Day, in conjunction with the 
            University Regiment, the renewal of the WW1 Honour Board , and an Online WW2 Nominal Roll have 
            received modest but helpful Grants.
       </p>
       <p>From small leaflets commemorating the Old Dolphin Theatre, Anniversaries of the Sunken Garden 
            Amphitheatre, the Octagon and New Fortune theatres, more substantial publications have been 
            created by the small group of volunteers. ‘Personalities and Places on the Crawley Campus’ has 
            already needed a reprint.
       </p> 
       <p>The University Archivist is an ex-officio member of the annually elected working Committee. 
            The membership fee is modest and open to all interested in the Society’s aims.

        <p style="font-family:'TTNormsPro',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bolder;"> 
            This website was made by Team 32, a group of students from the CITS3200 unit as part of their main project for the second semester of 2022.
            With the help of our mentor Tom from PWC as well as Dr. Margot Warburton and Joan Pope, we are proud to present UWA Plaques. Our aim is to
            raise awareness about the rich history behind campus, to make both students and the general public appreciate the different stories that 
            the university has to offer. Despite its name, the locations that we have aren't restricted to just those with plaques. We felt as though
            it was important to capture more than what just the university themselves have recognised to be of significance as the campus provides for
            a variety of many other locations with a deeper story behind them.
