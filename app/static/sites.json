With 683 tiered seats, the Octagon is incredibly versatile. The thrust stage can be increased to 12 metres wide, or entirely removed, allowing additional seating. Removing half the stage reveals an orchestra pit. The theatre's excellent sightlines are unique in Perth. <br><br> In 1965, the University of Western Australia announced that architect Peter Parkinson had been awarded the commission for the new University Lecture Theatre.  After considerable pressure from the English Department, led by Professor Allan Edwards, the University decided to build a multi-purpose theatre and to set up a Theatre Committee to oversee the project. Although it was intended that the theatre be used for drama, the use of Commonwealth Government funding for the project required that the theatre be primarily used for lectures. Hence the project was described as the University Lecture Theatre (ULT). The Octagon Theatre commission was to set Parkinson on his career as a theatre architect. In the early seventies the Federal government invested money heavily in campus buildings, many tertiary institutions took the opportunity to build performance buildings. <br><br>Parkinson’s interest in transformable theatre spaces identified him from an early stage with the prevailing modernist concern to incorporate technology in all buildings. At Dr Philip Parson’s suggestion, Sir Tyrone Guthrie was invited to Perth to advise them and when Guthrie arrived in Perth in July 1965 it must have seemed to Guthrie that Peter Parkinson promised to match Guthrie’s description of the ideal theatre architect. <br><br>The WA Architectural fraternity responded to Parkinson’s elegantly simple design by awarding the Octagon Theatre an RAIA (WA) Bronze Medal Citation (1969).

The long gestation of ideas is evident in all Howard Taylor's work, and this project exemplifies the important process of reduction down to fundamentals. <br><br>Howard Taylor [1918 – 2001], a painter and sculptor of the natural sublime - austere, and mostly abstract .  From childhood in Adelaide; the boy liked intricate machinery, and made model aircraft. He enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1937. Graduating top of his class, he was transferred to Britain, shot down in 1940 over Europe, and spent five years in German camps. To fill the days he made life-drawings of his fellow-prisoners. When he returned from post-war study at the Birmingham College of Art in 1949 the bush at Bickley, near Perth, entered his art. In 1967 he shifted to Northcliffe in the karri-forest country, near the wild granite coastland facing the Southern Ocean. Taylor was the first recipient of the Australia Council’s Visual Arts Board’s Emeritus Awards. In 1998 he was designated a WA State Living Treasure. </p>",

It had been created by University Dramatic Society students and staff from the former Electrical Engineering shed behind Shenton House, one of the corrugated iron and weatherboard buildings from the 1913 Irwin St campus. The cool-room creamery of the original Crawley Park farm was used as a dressing room. <br><br>The ‘new’ theatre was designed by renowned architect, theatre consultant and former Faculty of Architecture staff, member Peter Parkinson (1925 – 2014) MBE LFRAIA RIBA.

Normally we measure time relative to midday, when the sun is highest in the sky. This sundial measures time relative to sunset and indicates how many hours of daylight remain.<br><br>Shaun Tan’s ‘Hours to Sunset’ was the gift of Convocation and the Hawaiian group, to the Centenial  of the UWA.  Dr Peter Kovesi from the Centre for Explortaion Targeting calculated the shadow lines required and Shaun transformed them into a fantastical art work with colours representing the West Australian coastal landscape. \n Tan is a UWA graduate with Honours in Fine Arts and Literature. He is an Academy Award winner for his work ‘The Lost Thing’ and holds many awards for his contribution to children and young peoples’ literature. <br><br>He used traditional Venetian glass making methods combined with modern industrial techinques. The sundial image was scanned and reproduced as a pixellated image used to establish sheets to produce 337500 tessara.  A number of people assisted by adding the tiles as the work progressed. The little courtyard with the Golden Eggs is gently lit at night. <br><br> A gnomon, projecting horizontally from the top centre point of the sundial, casts a shadow on the wall. During the course of the afternoon the tip of the gnomon's shadow will move from the bottom of the wall up to the top until, at sunset, it is level with the gnomon. The left hand curve of the sundial's markings plots the path of the Sun's shadow during the summer solstice, the middle line is the path during the equinox, and the curve on the right shows its path at the winter solstice. The hour lines are angled to account for the different length of day between summer and winter. <br><br>This project originated when Susan Marie, then Director of University Extension Services, and Board member of the UWA Club, commissioned Shaun Tan to create a west-facing sundial.  Ian Middleton, artisan tiler, executed the work. Susan Marie was the project coordinator. For more information visit <a href='//www.culturalprecinct.uwa.edu.au/about/hours-to-sunset'>here</a> </p>",
